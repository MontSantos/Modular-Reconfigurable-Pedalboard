# Modular Reconfigurable Pedalboard
A modular, reconfigurable guitar/bass pedalboard designed as a **universal base** for **interchangeable effect modules**.  
Current version includes two analog effect circuits: an **MXR-style Distortion+ inspired clone** and a **silicon Fuzz Face–inspired fuzz**.

---

## Features (current)

- A modular board capable of hosting **two 8 pin effect modules** simultaneously
- Two analog effect modules included:
  - **MXR-style distortion** (Distortion+/D+ family inspiration)
  - **Silicon Fuzz Face–inspired fuzz**
- Each module supports **up to two PCB-mounted potentiometers** for onboard control (e.g., Gain/Level, Fuzz/Volume)
- Designed for common use with string instruments, such as **electric guitars** or **basses**
- Fully **customizable** and **open-source** for public access

## Included effect modules

### 1) Silicon Fuzz Face–inspired fuzz

A two-transistor silicon fuzz, implemented with a **negative-ground** power scheme for easy integration with other pedal models.
Great for raw, dirty and aggressive tones.

### 2) MXR-style distortion (Distortion+ inspired)

A classic op-amp gain stage with germanium diode clipping (the “raw” distortion character).  
Useful for gritty tones.
